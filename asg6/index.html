	<h1>Six Thinking Hats Summary</h1>
	<h2 class="white">White hat</h2>
	<p>When I looked at the facts, I realized I have a clear vision for the recipe project: a platform where people can easily share, discover, and organize recipes. I also noted what’s missing, like detailed information on how to structure user accounts, how recipes will be categorized, and what features will best encourage interaction. Focusing on the facts helped me see what I already know and what I still need to research to make the platform practical and user-friendly.</p>
	<h2 class="red">Red hat</h2>
	<p>When I shared how I felt about the project, I was excited but also a little nervous. They said they felt excited too, but also a bit unsure about whether everything would work out. Talking about our feelings helped us realize that the project has a lot of potential, but I need to stay realistic about challenges.</p>
	<h2 class="black">Black hat</h2>
	<p>I raised concerns about money and whether the project could handle growth if it gets popular. They also pointed out that it’s important to keep the platform simple and easy to use. This discussion helped me see the risks more clearly and think about how to plan for them.</p>
	<h2 class="yellow">Yellow hat</h2>
	<p>Looking at the positives, I could see how the project could connect people and inspire creativity in cooking. They agreed and added that even small successes could help build momentum. It made me realize that, despite challenges, the project could really bring value to the cooking community.</p>
	<h2 class="green">Green hat</h2>
	<p>I suggested breaking the project into smaller phases, while they added ideas like recipe challenges and interactive features. Some ideas might not work perfectly, but together we discovered new ways to make the project more fun and engaging. This gave me fresh ways to think about the project.</p>
	<h2 class="blue">Blue hat</h2>
	<p>When I stepped back, I saw that we needed a clear plan. We decided to first fill in the missing information, then try out creative ideas, and finally weigh risks and benefits. This step-by-step approach made sense to both of us and helped me feel more confident about moving forward.</p>
	<h3>How has my project changed as a result of this discussion?</h3>
	<p><img src="/asg6/images/yellow-hat.png" alt="yellow hat" class="yellow-hat">After using the Six Thinking Hats, I see my recipe project in a clearer way. I know I need to keep it simple, focus on building community, and be careful about risks like complexity or competition. The creative ideas, like recipe challenges, gave me new energy, and now I have a step-by-step plan to grow while keeping food and connection at the center.</p>
