		<h2>What I'd like to do for my semester project</h2>
		<p>One of my favorite hobbies is cooking, I love learning new recipes and challenging myself to new cooking techniques and cuisines. This past year, I have started a notes page on my own cooking creation to try out. I would love to make a website for others to also add in their creations. With this website, I would love to add recipes and an area for my audience to comment and give constructive critisism. This also opens up a space for others who would love to get their recipes tested by others an area to do so.</p>
