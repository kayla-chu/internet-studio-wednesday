    <ul>
        <li><strong>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</strong></li>
        <p>Semantic HTML focuses on using the correct markup elements so that the meaning of content is clear to both humans and machines. Structured content organizes information into reusable and well-defined pieces, like separating an article’s title, author, and body into distinct fields within a content system. While semantic HTML ensures clarity on a single webpage, structured content is designed for flexibility and portability, allowing information to be understood and delivered across multiple platforms, including websites, apps, and voice assistants.</p>
        <li><strong>How do they work together?</strong></li>
        <p>Structured content and semantic HTML work together by making information both reusable and understandable across platforms. They allow smart agents like Google Assistant to interpret and present content accurately, making it accessible for both human readers and intelligent systems.</p>
        <li><strong>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</strong></li>
        <p>Having both structured content and semantic HTML is important because it makes web content clear, reusable, and machine-readable. Structured content ensures information can be delivered across different platforms while semantic HTML communicates its meaning on the page. Together, they improve accessibility, search visibility, and the ability for smart agents to provide accurate answers to users.</p>

<h2>Required Readings Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</li>
        <p>Denise Jacobs says our inner critic is like a troll that blocks creativity, but she offers ways to push past it. The method that would work best for me is the “bait-and-switch” tactic, where I tell myself I’m just preparing instead of doing the real task. This lowers the pressure, quiets my critic, and helps me get started. Once I’m in motion, it’s much easier to keep going and actually finish the work.</p>
        <li>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</li>
       <p>In David McRaney’s article “Procrastination,” hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to choose smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones, even when waiting would be more beneficial. To counter this, McRaney highlights precommitment through staggered deadlines, showing that students with evenly spaced due dates performed best because they couldn’t procrastinate until the last minute. For me, setting mini-deadlines would work best since it breaks big tasks into smaller steps, keeps me accountable, and prevents last-minute stress.</p>
        <li>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</li>
        <p>A network-making power I do not think I have is the third one, I think I have much more to learn in order to see which nodes hve more power in coding rather than the base of coding. When I create and publish work online, I have some power because I choose what to share, how it looks, and how people can move through it. This lets me shape how others experience my site.</p>
