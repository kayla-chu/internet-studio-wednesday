        <li><strong>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</strong></li>
        <p>Semantic HTML focuses on using the correct markup elements so that the meaning of content is clear to both humans and machines. Structured content organizes information into reusable and well-defined pieces, like separating an articleâ€™s title, author, and body into distinct fields within a content system. While semantic HTML ensures clarity on a single webpage, structured content is designed for flexibility and portability, allowing information to be understood and delivered across multiple platforms, including websites, apps, and voice assistants.</p>
        <li><strong>How do they work together?</strong></li>
        <p>Structured content and semantic HTML work together by making information both reusable and understandable across platforms. They allow smart agents like Google Assistant to interpret and present content accurately, making it accessible for both human readers and intelligent systems.</p>
        <li><strong>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</strong></li>
        <p>Having both structured content and semantic HTML is important because it makes web content clear, reusable, and machine-readable. Structured content ensures information can be delivered across different platforms while semantic HTML communicates its meaning on the page. Together, they improve accessibility, search visibility, and the ability for smart agents to provide accurate answers to users.</p>
