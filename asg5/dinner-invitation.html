	<h1>Dinner Invitation: Who would you like to dine with?</h1>
	<h2>Guests of Honor</h2>
	<h3>Shawn Mendes</h3>
	<p>I would love to invite Shawn Mendes to dinner because he has such a genuine and down-to-earth personality, despite his worldwide success. His music carries so much emotion and positivity, and I admire how he uses his platform to spread kindness and inspire others. Having him at the table would bring warmth, thoughtful conversation, and maybe even a spontaneous performance that would make the evening unforgettable.</p>
	<h3>Kim Taehyung (V from BTS)</h3>
	<p>Kim Taehyung would be an amazing dinner guest because of his unique artistic perspective and his ability to bring joy to any situation. Not only is he a talented singer and performer, but he also has a deep appreciation for art, photography, and self-expression. His playful yet thoughtful nature would make the dinner lively and meaningful, giving everyone a chance to see the world through his creative lens.</p>
	<h3>Daniel Seavey</h3>
	<p>I would like to invite Daniel Seavey to dinner because of his incredible talent and humble personality. He’s a multi-instrumentalist and songwriter who has shown passion and dedication from such a young age, and I admire the way he brings authenticity to his music. Having him over would create a relaxed and inspiring atmosphere, as he seems like the kind of person who would share fun stories while also offering real insight into the creative process.</p>

	<h2>Required Reading Questions</h2>
	<ul>
        <li><strong>From the <em>Do's and Don'ts of Web Design</em>, provide a link to an example of a violation of number 6 (clickable elements are not obvious).</strong></li>
        <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/404" target="blank">Amazon.com</a></p>
		<li><strong>From the <em>Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles</em>: How can framing your project in a story format help you refine your ideas? Write a paragraph explanation.</strong></li>
        <p>Framing a project in a story format refines ideas by grounding abstract goals in a human-centered narrative. Storytelling defines the user as the “hero,” clarifies their journey, and highlights the emotional and strategic goals at stake. This approach unites teams around a shared vision, turning scattered data or requirements into a clear direction. By focusing on the user’s story, designers build empathy and ensure solutions feel purposeful and cohesive before design work even begins.</p>
		<li><strong>From <em>Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography</em>: What are different ways to establish hierarchy (or emphasis) in typography design? Provide a link to a good example of hierarchy.</strong></li>
        <p>Designers can create typographic hierarchy by manipulating size, weight, color, style, and spacing. Increasing the size of key text (like headlines) naturally draws the eye, while bold or heavier weights add visual importance. Color can highlight or soften elements, making vibrant or high-contrast hues stand out, while muted tones recede. Playing with styles such as italics, uppercase, or small caps, adds another layer of nuance. And thoughtful spacing or proximity (adjusting margins, line height, and grouping) helps guide the reader through an intentional flow.</p>
