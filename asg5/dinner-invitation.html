	<h1>Dinner Invitation: Who would you like to dine with?</h1>
	<h2>Guests of Honor</h2>
	<h3 class="shawn-mendes">Shawn Mendes</h3>

	<p>I would love to invite Shawn Mendes to dinner because he has such a genuine and down-to-earth personality, despite his worldwide success. His music carries so much emotion and positivity, and I admire how he uses his platform to spread kindness and inspire others. Having him at the table would bring warmth, thoughtful conversation, and maybe even a spontaneous performance that would make the evening unforgettable.</p>
	<h3 class="kim-taehyung">Kim Taehyung (V from BTS)</h3>
	<img src="/assets/img/kim-taehyung.jpg" alt="">
	<p>Kim Taehyung would be an amazing dinner guest because of his unique artistic perspective and his ability to bring joy to any situation. Not only is he a talented singer and performer, but he also has a deep appreciation for art, photography, and self-expression. His playful yet thoughtful nature would make the dinner lively and meaningful, giving everyone a chance to see the world through his creative lens.</p>
	<h3 class="daniel-seavey">Daniel Seavey</h3>
	<img src="/assets/img/daniel-seavey.jpg" alt="">
	<p>I would like to invite Daniel Seavey to dinner because of his incredible talent and humble personality. He’s a multi-instrumentalist and songwriter who has shown passion and dedication from such a young age, and I admire the way he brings authenticity to his music. Having him over would create a relaxed and inspiring atmosphere, as he seems like the kind of person who would share fun stories while also offering real insight into the creative process.</p>
