	<h2>Discussion with classmate</h2>

		<li>inclusiverecipes.blog</li>
	</ol>
	<p>My classmate and I discussed which domain name best represents the theme and purpose of my project. They liked aroundtheplate.food because it feels welcoming and fits well with a recipe or food-sharing site. We also considered inclusiverecipes.blog for its focus on accessibility and community, but decided it sounds more like a blog than a full website. atyourservice.food felt more like a catering or hospitality site. In the end, we agreed that aroundtheplate.food best captures the friendly, inclusive atmosphere of the project.</p>
	<h2>The domain name I like best and why</h2>
	<p>The domain name I like best is aroundtheplate.food because it feels warm, inviting, and community-oriented. It suggests people coming together to share meals and stories, which aligns perfectly with the purpose of my project, which is to create an inclusive space where everyone can explore and enjoy recipes from different backgrounds.</p>
