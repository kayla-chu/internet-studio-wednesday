	<h1>Kayla Chu</h1>
	<p>My name is Kayla and I am currently studying digital media marketing at University of Texas at Dallas. I've moved around a lot in my life. I was originally born in Chicago, Illinois, then my family moved to New Jersey, then Hong Kong, then Austin. I moved to Dallas for school, but I plan on staying here long-term. One of my favorite things to do during my free-time is cooking. I love cooking anything asian cuisine related and am always excited to learn new recipes! One of my biggest goals in life is to be able to travel the world and try all sorts of different foods. I love going out of country and learning more about each country's culture!</p>
