	<h2>The Guide to Wireframing</h2>
	<h3>What are the advantages and disadvantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software?</h3>
	<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
	<p>When I sketch wireframes, I find it fast and flexible. It lets me quickly get my ideas out without being distracted by tools or visual details. I can freely explore layouts, structures, and interactions right as they come to mind. Sketching helps me focus more on the core idea rather than worrying about fonts or colors.</p>
	<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
	<p>However, I’ve noticed that sketching also has its drawbacks. I usually have to recreate my sketches digitally later, which takes extra time. It’s also hard to make my sketches interactive or share them easily with others. There’s no version control, and sometimes my proportions are off or messy, which can make them unclear.</p>
	<h3>Write a paragraph on which type of wireframing style would work best with your project and why.</h3>
	<p>For my project, I think digital wireframing works best. Since I’m working on an IoT concept that connects devices and users through different screens, I need something that allows me to keep everything consistent and easy to update. Digital tools like Figma or wireframe.cc let me build interactive prototypes and share them with others for feedback. Still, I like to start with quick hand sketches first because it helps me brainstorm freely before moving into a structured digital format.</p>
