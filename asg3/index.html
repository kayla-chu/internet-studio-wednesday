	<h2>Required reading questions</h2>
	<ul>
        <li><strong>From the <em>Do's and Don'ts of Web Design</em>, provide a link to an example of a violation of number 6 (clickable elements are not obvious).</strong></li>
        <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/404" target="blank">Amazon.com</a></p>
		<li><strong>From the <em>Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles</em>: How can framing your project in a story format help you refine your ideas? Write a paragraph explanation.</strong></li>
        <p>Framing a project in a story format refines ideas by grounding abstract goals in a human-centered narrative. Storytelling defines the user as the “hero,” clarifies their journey, and highlights the emotional and strategic goals at stake. This approach unites teams around a shared vision, turning scattered data or requirements into a clear direction. By focusing on the user’s story, designers build empathy and ensure solutions feel purposeful and cohesive before design work even begins.</p>
		<li><strong>From <em>Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography</em>: What are different ways to establish hierarchy (or emphasis) in typography design? Provide a link to a good example of hierarchy.</strong></li>
        <p>Designers can create typographic hierarchy by manipulating size, weight, color, style, and spacing. Increasing the size of key text (like headlines) naturally draws the eye, while bold or heavier weights add visual importance. Color can highlight or soften elements, making vibrant or high-contrast hues stand out, while muted tones recede. Playing with styles such as italics, uppercase, or small caps, adds another layer of nuance. And thoughtful spacing or proximity (adjusting margins, line height, and grouping) helps guide the reader through an intentional flow.</p>

		<h2>What I'd like to do for my semester project</h2>
		<p>One of my favorite hobbies is cooking, I love learning new recipes and challenging myself to new cooking techniques and cuisines. This past year, I have started a notes page on my own cooking creation to try out. I would love to make a website for others to also add in their creations. With this website, I would love to add recipes and an area for my audience to comment and give constructive critisism. This also opens up a space for others who would love to get their recipes tested by others an area to do so.</p>
