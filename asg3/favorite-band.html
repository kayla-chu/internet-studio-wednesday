	<h1>Favorite Band: BTS</h1>
	<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS" target="blank">BTS</a> (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit. Bulletproof Boy Scouts), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook, who co-write or co-produce much of their material. Originally a hip hop group, they expanded their musical style to incorporate a wide range of genres, while their lyrics have focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has also referenced literature, philosophy and psychology, and includes an alternate universe storyline.</strong></p>
	<h2>Why they are my favorite band</h2>
	<p>BTS has been my favorite band for the past 3 years. Their success and determination has inspired me in many ways. The amount of backlash they recieved when they just broke international records were astounding. But they never gave up, they just tried harder. BTS is the role model for perseverance and not letting the hate hurt them or make them give up. While English is none of their native language, they strive and try to better themselves each debut to connect with people outside their country more. They each have such unique backstories and origins. There are 7 members in total, each contribute in their own ways to make BTS as well known and successful has it is now.</p>
